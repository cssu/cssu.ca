summary: 'About the Computer Science Student Union'
---

The Computer Science Student Union (CSSU) represents over **7250** Computer Science students who are either taking a Computer Science course or are part of a Computer Science program at the University of Toronto St. George campus. We are a student-governed body that receives funding from the Arts & Science Studentsâ€™ Union, the Department of Computer Science, and our union store. The description of the structure, rules, and processes of the CSSU are described in our [constitution](/constitution.pdf). The primary goal of the CSSU team is to improve the academic, social, and professional lives of computer science students. We pursue that goal via:

-   **Social Activities**: organizing social events to help students in making friends in their program and form networks of mutual support.
-   **Professional Development**: providing students with networking and professional skill development opportunities to facilitate success in their careers.
-   **Academic Opportunities**: presenting resources and opportunities to help students embed themselves in the world of academic computer science and share their work with their peers.
-   **Undergrad and Department Liaison**: empowering students in their studies and advocating for their interests at the departmental, faculty, and university levels.

You can visit us in room 2250 in the [Bahen Centre for Information Technology](https://goo.gl/maps/16JTD3pr2KKMkCTE7) or email us at [executive@cssu.ca](mailto:executive@cssu.ca). [See Office Hours.](/ba2250)

## Office Operations

The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in BA 2250 in which students can hang out, network, play games, ask questions, and study. Office Operations volunteers, or Office Ops, help manage the lounge, kitchenette, gaming centre, and study spaces. They also assist in answering questions and directing students to appropriate resources. Typically, Executive and General Council members also serve Office Ops shifts. [See Office Hours.](/ba2250)
