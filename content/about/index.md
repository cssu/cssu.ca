---

The Computer Science Student Union, or CSSU for short, represents over 1200 Computer Science students who are either taking a Computer Science course or are part of a Computer Science POSt at the University of Toronto St. George campus. We are a student governed body that receives funding from the Arts and Sciences' Student Union, the Department of Computer Science, and our union store. The description of the structure, rules, and processes of the union are described in our [**constitution**](/constitution.pdf). The primary goal for the CSSU team is to improve the academic, social, and professional lives of computer science students. To do so, we intend to focus on the following:

- **Social Activities**: organize social events to help students in making friends in their program and form networks of mutual support.
- **Professional Development**: provide students with networking and professional skill development opportunities to facilitate success in their careers.
- **Academic Opportunities**: present adequate resources and opportunities to help them embed themselves in the world of academic computer science and share their work with their peers.
- **Undergrad and Department Liaison**: assist students in studies and advocate for their interests at a departmental, faculty, and university level.

You can visit us at BA2250 in the [Bahen Centre for Information Technology](https://goo.gl/maps/16JTD3pr2KKMkCTE7) or email us at [utcssu@gmail.com](mailto:utcssu@gmail.com). **[See Office Hours.](/ba2250)**

## Office Operations

The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in BA 2250 in which students can hang out, network, play games and ask questions. Office operations volunteers help manage the lounge, the store/stockroom, kitchen, gaming centre, and study spaces. They also assist in answering questions and directing students to appropriate resources. Members of the Executive and General Councils also generally serve shifts in office operations.

_Office operations are set to resume on a limited basis. As such, only members of the Executive and General Councils will be holding office hours in the lounge. **[See Office Hours.](/ba2250)**_
