The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in BA 2250 in which students can hang out, network, play games and ask questions. We have a snack store, gaming centre, study spaces and more! Office operations volunteers manage the lounge, assist in answering questions, and directing students to appropriate resources.

## What we Have

- Store stocked with common snacks for student purchase. We also half a free/loan shelf.
- Kitchenette with fridge, sink, microwave, kettle, and basic utensils/tools. (restricted due to COVID-19)
- Entertainment/gaming centre, with a variety of modern, arcade, retro, and party games. (restricted due to COVID-19)
- Library shelf lined with books in topics such as mathematics, algorithms/data structures, programming, philosophy. Books can be loaned with a piece of UofT/government ID.

### Library & Whiteboard

Over the years, we've collected many books from generous (or forgetful!) students, and we proudly maintain a new cozy home for them. We hope that our library shelf provides more accessibility to student learning and curiosity. Students can read in the study space, or loan a book out with a deposit of a piece of UofT/government ID. If you'd like to donate a book, please speak to the office manager on duty!

You can use the dry-erase markers/erasers at the whiteboard; to borrow one, please deposit of a piece of UofT/government ID. You can also purchase new markers at the store.
