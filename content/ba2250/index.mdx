summary: "The Undergraduate Computer Science Lounge"
---

The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in [BA2250](https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494470) in which students can hang out, network, play games, and ask questions. We have a snack store, a gaming centre, study spaces, and more! Office operations volunteers manage the lounge, answer questions, and direct students to appropriate resources.

## What We Have

-   Store stocked with common snacks for student purchase. We also have a free/loan shelf.
-   Kitchenette with fridge, sink, microwave, kettle, and basic utensils and tools.
-   Entertainment/gaming centre, with a variety of modern, arcade, retro, and party games.
-   Library shelf lined with books on topics such as mathematics, algorithms and data structures, programming, and philosophy. Students can borrow a book by depositing a piece of UofT or government ID with the lounge volunteer.

### Store

For your convenience, we sell a variety of food items in the lounge. Anyone can come by during open hours and purchase a snack or beverage using a debit or credit card (for purchases of $1 or more) or cash. Please be kind to the person assisting you with your purchase at the desk; they are a volunteer!

### Library and Whiteboard

Over the years, we've collected many books from generous (or forgetful!) students, and we proudly maintain a new cozy home for them. We hope that our library shelf provides more accessibility to student learning and curiosity. Students can read in the study space or loan a book out with a deposit of a piece of UofT or government ID. If you'd like to donate a book, please speak to the office manager on duty!

You can use the dry-erase markers or erasers at the whiteboard; to borrow one, please deposit a piece of UofT or government ID with the lounge volunteer.
