}

The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in BA 2250 in which students can hang out, network, play games and ask questions. We have a snack store, gaming centre, study spaces and more! Office operations volunteers manage the lounge, assist in answering questions, and directing students to appropriate resources.

Thanks for volunteering! It will be a great opportunity to network and engage with your fellow students. First and foremost, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/R9hneMaafD). The following is a guide on managing the lounge for volunteers. Also feel free to join our [unofficial Discord server](https://discord.gg/w7hWTEkF) to connect with more UofT CS students!

## Room Access

As of January 2024, the following is in effect.

- Volunteers will have 8AM-9PM access on weekdays.
- Members of the Executive Council shall have access outside of these hours to the lounge (BA2250) and storage room (BA2285).

## Snack Store

The CSSU maintains a snack store, the proceeds of which are put back into the CSSU treasury in compliance with charity regulations.

- Most items are kept on the snack shelf (the white one) and the red fridge.
- Ice-cream sandwiches are stored in freezer in the kitchenette.
- Volunteers are expected to make sales on Square. Log-in to the iPad, open the app, and tap on the items they're selling.
- Please do not accept card payments for sales totalling less than $1.00; encourage customers to pay in cash or buy multiple items.
- If the snack shelf or cooler are running low on items, restock from the black cabinet.
- We also have a free shelf (the grey one) with stationery, culinary, and sex supplies. Please ensure that students take things in moderation.

## Library

- Books and loose dry-erase whiteboard markers are free for use in the lounge.
- If a student wants to loan a book, ask them to deposit some form of ID (TCard, driver's licence, Ontario Photo Card, or passport).
- You may accept a health card if a student offers it, but we cannot request a health card by law.

## Gaming Systems

- Students may use the gaming consoles and display systems.
- Please be vigilant about the controllers and equipment; instances of theft have been reported in the past.

## Kitchenette

- Students are free to use the microwave, kettle, and sink.
- The silver refrigerator is open for use given that the users understand they can only pick up their items when there's a volunteer on duty.
- Please ensure students tag any items put into the fridge with a sticky note or marker. Sometimes there are freebies in here and we don't want someone to accidentally take a student's item because it wasn't labeled. This also helps with cleaning the fridge out.
- The freezer is often full with ice cream sandwiches, but students may store things in the door if they fit.

## Lost Items

- Lost items found in the building are often turned into the CSSU. Please try to locate the owner using any information on if it is possible.
- If an item is very expensive and you cannot determine the owner, please ask the student to turn it into caretaking or Campus Safety.
- With lost TCards, you can email the student by sending an email to \<their_utorid\>@mail.utoronto.ca, this will alias to their UofT inbox, but it will not show up in your outlook directory.
- When emailing a student about a lost item, please CC [utcssu@gmail.com](mailto:utcssu@gmail.com). For higher value items also post in the #office-ops channel.

## Other Things

- Try to answer student questions to the best of your ability; if you don't know the answer, you can ask in the #office-ops channel or direct them elsewhere.
- Other people such as caretaking staff, instructors, student family, are also welcome.
- Let the Executive Council know if you need anything from the storage room.
- Ensure that everyone is comfortable and observing the [code of conduct](../ba2250).
- If you can't make your shift for any reason, just let us know in #office-ops on Discord.
- Students often come in looking for BA2270, that is the TA help centre next door. Please direct them their if they are asking where course office hours are.
